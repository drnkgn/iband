tunggu. Customary law fine agreed by the parties, payable to injured party (individual or group), pe-t., adat: t. tinggal, fine for desertion (divorce) of spouse; tusun t., list or code of fines; nunggu, levy a fine on. Names of fines, except for matrimonial offences, usu. omit the word t.: e.g., enselan, penti, pemali, pemalu, pelasi' menoa. T. are not penal in intent but compensatory in the sense that they neutralize the ill effect of the offence and restore the state of harmony (celap) in the community and between it and the deities. This state has been secured by the tuai rumah through omens and rites and keeping of amulets (pencelap) for the purpose, so he is entitled to hear cases and assess t. He may retain part (lantan) of small fines (those reduced by tikai kajang) to provide minor rites for the house to restore its state: the amounts are small and do not recompense him for entertaining the parties during a hearing. If sickness or a death occurs in the house before a t. is paid, it is attributed to the offender who must pay an increased fine (kere- san, tungkal). T. cannot be enforced so they are not imposed (cf. UKUM) but agreed and submitted to in the presence of an arbitrator. An offender may be asked: dinika' di'? ngena' KAJANG tau'-ka kijang? which will you agree to? (to pay) palm mat or barking deer? (i.e., light fine by 'folding the mat' or heavy in fortieths of PIKUL or in dollars: explanation being kajang perut puang, sigi' lempong; ki-jang perut kenyang, sigi' berat, folded mat is empty-bellied and light, the deer is full fed and heavy. 'Codes' of fines exist for the Rajang (Meluan 1936, revised Sibu 1952) and 2nd Div. (Simanggang 1961) which act as guides to offences and precedents: t. are stated in terms of money with only gen. reference to property transferred (utai redak, 'accessories', properly karong kerubong or sangkar) or to sacrifice and offering (piring), which are more important and together constitute the rite of ENSELAN (genselan). An offering is always made with sacrifice of egg or fowl: a pig will be used only for serious offences (mali) as part of pelasi' menoa. Besides money, property transferred will inch: (a) iron, papong besi, duku'sa-bilah, as kering semengat; (b) pottery, pinggai sa- singkap, tajau; and may incl. (c) beads, e.g., kelam, pelaga; (d) bronze ware, tawak, bendai, etc. Beads and pottery, whether actual or re-placed by money, are often called by names of costly items no longer available. Bronze has long been stated by weight in KATI or pikul, or in old money terms unrelated to current values. Small fines are often stated in terms of jars, esp. in 2nd Div., though paid in agreed local money equivalents. H. gives 2nd Div. lists of jars with equivalents which combine to make a guide still useful: alas, $4-8; alas ngerang, $5; irun, 24-50c.; jabir, kuna, $1-2; menaga, $20-57.60 (2 pikul); menukul, 50c.- $1; ningka, $32; ponding, $2-4; runggu, 18- 36c.; rusa', $10-28.80 (1 pikul); tepayan, 12-18c; uta, 25c. These values are halved in the Spak and Ulu Layar: in the Rajang, a menukul (mungkul) is $1 and a kuna $2: in the Krian, uta is said to be not a jar but 2 dishes or 8 bowls.
