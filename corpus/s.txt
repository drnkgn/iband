First to sing s. was REMI. Another story tells that a woman called Selaka was weeding her padi when people going to a gawai took her with them: they were Sebayan going to a gawai antu, who taught her about the soul's journey and made her the first lemambang s. Lemambang s. may be man or woman, but most are women. A few use visual aids (turai) when teaching to others the details (gerini') of complex passages, but the main poem (batang) is always remembered by heart. The singer sits by the sapat (screens), holding a cloth with her left hand to cover her face, with her right holding the hand of friend or supporter, and with her foot on a piece of iron to strengthen her spirit (kering semengat). In some places she sits in a swing (wa'): cf. ensera, bayoh. The singer's own spirit also goes to the other world in order to describe it and she 'loses herself' in the telling: precautions are taken to secure her spirit's return; cf. pengap. When the dead are called to a festival (gawai antu) and not to fetch away a soul the message is sent by the Wind (ribut) and the story is chiefly about the preparations of the Sebayan and their journey to attend, as in other pengap invocations. In s., it is the soul's journey from the land of the living to the land of the dead that is described. S. begins with a short introduction and an address to the dead ('why sleep so long?'): the reply tells of illness and how all is now dark and insubstantial. Each part of the rqom and house is mentioned (nyenggai' nyuran timbal rumah) with its importance to the living, but always the dead are unable to feel, touch, or grip it. The Sebayan arrive, led by (Lemanak, Julau) Caung, Cenclan, (Ulu Ai) Jubang, or (Saribas) Niram, Ngerai. They are briefly described and persuaded to leave amulets behind in exchange for the soul. Sebayan may enter the house but usu. they wait outside at foot of steps until the soul is persuaded to follow them. Appearance of a butterfly (kesulai) marks the arrival of the Sebayan, or of the soul of one who has died far from home returning to claim proper rites. The soul passes along the tempuan ruai and out at the end of the house to join its ancestor companions and follow roughly the path of the burial party. Each part of the familiar menoa is described with sorrow. At length the Seven River Mouths are reached (the left leads to Sebayan) and the dwellings of forest demons (antu). In the abode of birds the chief is now Bubut (Coucal) who lives by Titi Rawan (Fearful Bridge): the bold cross with ease, but the timid find the bridge has shrunk to a beanpole and wobbles above the chasm in which Ai' Limb an runs. Next the soul sees the grave goods (baya') ready for its use and comes to PINTU Tanah (Earth's Door), a pair of massive close-fitted doors of stone. When the Worm Queen, Kumang, opens the doors for them, they pass through to the land of cockfighting, domain of Sang Juara (often calling Ensing Jara, though not a bird). Here lie the lands of those who have died unnatural deaths, e.g., at birth or by drowning, and have not been given proper burial. At the landing place on the bank of the MANDAI they find the coffin-like boat (berangai) of the new soul. It has to be covered with cloths (pua'): for a warrior the roof frame (tajok) is of enemies' bones, others use blowpipes (sumpit). As the party goes downriver, mention is made of fish, Genali, and all who live in or by water. When they land near their house, they admire Pun Ranyai (Nibong Ranyai, Ensurai Ranjing), a tree or palm which bears valuables as fruit: it sways (berayah) so only those skilled in war can leap and cut down fruit, which they keep as amulets to help their living descendants. The party bathe and go up to the longhouse. The newcomer is greeted by relatives long dead, calmed, and led to cease sorrowing. There is no final separation from the living for visits are made with amulets or, as dew (ambun), to help growth of padi. Finally the singer departs by leave of Dara Rambai Geruda, is borne back to her body among the living by the Wind, and dries her eyes (palit mata). The theme is constant and the effect is to assuage grief among the living; but a skilled singer can incite hearers to revenge or make the s. a curse upon the enemies who caused the death. Versions are brought up to date, e.g., by use of outboard engines on the Mandai. Minda of Julau has altered her s. so that it can be used either for Christians or non-Christians. The journey is made flying in a 'boat' of cloth (pua') carried by the Wind: route and theme are the same but the flight passes beyond the furthest confines of Mandai with its demons and past the Gate of the Heavens (Pintu Langit). There the party meets stars (bintang) and moon (bulan), and a halt is made at the house of Segadu' who presents the new soul with a magical flying coat. They go overland to the ancestors' house. From it (if non-Christian) they can see across the stream to the Christian house and beyond into the Christian Heaven, Menoa Raja Tuan Pederi, which is described in apocalyptic terms. Full s. takes at least 2 nights to recite.

Fullest rites for the sick performed by MANANG when PELIAN rites have failed; cf. sagu: be-s.-ka, perform s. rites for. Emphasis is on the scorched or overgrown AYU, to whose place (.Bangkit) the manang go in spirit and, with celestial help, clear weeds (sempiang) and fence it (ngeraga) against evil. The pillar 'shrine' (pagar api) is symbolic: Bangkit at the foot, banana (pisang) stem the ayu stem, and cloth (pua') the leaf; and no banana or bamboo (buloh) may be cut down until well after the rites end. The rites are in 3 parts, (a) Beterayu mata', (lasts one night) pagar api is set up in the patient's ruai (gallery) and deities (petara), celestial manang, and Selempandai are called upon. (b) Beterayu mansau, when 3 offerings are made: to female deities (cast out at the back), to male deities (cast from the veranda), to Selempandai as maker of men (placed over the 'shrine'). Areca blossom (mayang pinang) and 3 rice' offerings (berau tumpu) are set by the 'shrine'. The patient sits on a gong (canang) by the 'shrine' and the manang go round it in-voking the deities. The manang engage lemambang to recite the pengap invocation. By mid-night the berau tumpu is removed and the manang rest. The process is repeated with 4 rice plates and at dawn with 5. The rite be-bangun (or besipat) follows, where the manang strike each other with the areca blossom until it is broken. Another blossom that has been decorated and oiled is then examined: if it is satisfactory the s. proper need not be per-formed and the beterayu mansau is com-pleted with a prayer (sampi) and a short rite by which the patient's name is changed (be-pindah or be-silihka nama) so that evil cannot find him. (c) S. proper is in 2 parts; nudok- (set or begin) and ngulurka s. (let down or re-move), each combined with full gawai sakit (ritual festival for the sick). A bad harvest after the first part will delay the second. At the end of either rite the patient's name is changed and his recovery marked by a new tattoo (pantang) and planting a 'croton' (sabang ayu). In nudok- ka s. the 'shrine' is ajar (tajau) filled with rice-beer (tuak) and secured by crossbars. The patient supplies a threshing frame (pelangka, panggau): to its legs which are oiled and scented are tied 4 bells (gerunong), 4 stone beads (pelaga), and 4 strings of beads (marik). Areca blossom is set ready and the manang make 3 rice offerings. They process along the gallery (ruai) with the patient and the pelangka. At the steps, the patient sits on a canang and the manang attack one another with the blossom. The procession returns to the 'shrine' through the inner gallery (tempuan ruai) where 8 plates of rice (berau indik) have been set for the manang to 'tread' upon. The manang bow to the 'shrine', climb over it in turn, join hands and go round it. At each stage some go into trance (luput). On recovery they enter the room to examine (betabas) the patient's state and settle their fee (sabang). Lemambang be-gin the pengap invocation. When the manang reappear, 9 plates of rice (berau tumpu) are set about the 'shrine', from which the manang take and throw rice into the air: they move round the 'shrine' chanting to fence the ayu (ngeraga Bangkit). Near dawn, the patient sits on a canang and leans against the 'shrine'. The manang set him on the pelangka and lift him up 7 times while a canang is sounded. Areca blossom is struck on a mat (rite of mecahka anak orang, lit., breaking the children, i.e., of evil): blossom is examined and, if satisfactory, the second part (ngulur) need not be performed but the patient's name is changed. For this, 10 plates of rice are set round the 'shrine'. The manang present the patient with a pelaga bead in exchange for rice and salt meat or fish. The pelangka is put in the room covered with red cloth: in it are placed tubai root, lukai wood, the manang's 'blinder' (engkerabun) and other amulets (pencelap), and betel (pinang). During a storm the tubai and lukai would be burned to keep off evil and the pelangka put in a mos-quito net (kibong). Some say the patient's soul (semengat) stays in or near the pelangka until the rites are complete. Ngulurka s. is the same ritual except that (a) the pelangka with the patient seated in it is lifted from the ruai into the loft (sadau) and let down through the 'pounding hole' (lubang penutok) seven times: (b) the pelangka is taken away by the manang or set adrift in the river.

All animate and inanimate things have s.: useful objects are put in or on a grave (as bay a') so that their s. can be used by the s. of the dead in Sebayan. Things or beings met with in dreams (mimpi) are their s., as it is the dreamer's s. that meets them; for the s. wanders from the body in dream, illness, or trance. S. is intangible and exactly like the body it inhabits (even to clothes) but it has an identity of its own: it is likened to a shadow. It is the 'size of a thumb', and enters and leaves the body by the fontanelle. In the body it is the 'size of a match head'. It feels no wounds inflicted on the body, it does not speak, and it travels at great speed. Any injury to the body that influences s. affects the AYU also. Some say a man has several 'souls' (e.g., ENSELUAI, ayu) even the 'round number' of seven, one of which resides in the head. The s. of one dead is usu. called antu (and may be separate). When the body is sick the s. leaves and begins the journey to Sebayan. While the body is unwell or weak (tabin sabarang, pansa' antu) it can live for some time while the 5. is absent. The very old often have their s. in Sebayan before they die. S. of manang and lemambang leave their bodies during rites to go on the journeys described in the poems. In sickness, it is part of the work of a manang (in PELIAN rites) to pursue and find the s. of the sick, to capture and bring it back. In death, s. goes beyond recall and completes the journey to Sebayan, as told in sabak poems, but it only realizes fully that the body is dead and separation (serara', of the dead ayu from its clump) has taken place when it has reached its house in Sebayan (Mandai) and been reconciled to the change by those already there. It is then said to be no longer 'home-sick' (enda' betah). Some say the s. leaves Mandai Awai and goes to Mandai Mati after Gawai Antu has been celebrated. At least until then the s. of the dead bring amulets to help the living or become dew to help the padi grow; and they may appear and guide the living in dreams and visions.
