    <h1>Abbreviations</h1>
    <p>
        Common English abbreviations are used for units of length, weight,
        volume, and currency; points of the compass; also cf. (compare),
        e.g. (for example), etc. (and others, and the like), i.e.
        (that is). The symbols ' and " for feet and inches (ft., in.),
        and the muliplication sign (Ã—) have been used where there is no
        risk of confusion.
