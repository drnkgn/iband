A fable accounts for the loss of the art of writing and Iban reliance on bird-omens. When crossing a flooded stream, the Europeans kept their writing dry under their hats; the Chinese (or Malays) put theirs on their shoulders so that it ran and smudged in the wet; the Iban carried theirs at the waist so that it be-came illegible to them. Once across, the Iban laid their paper on a log to dry in the sun, but a bird came down and snatched it away. A myth tells how Menggin obtained birdlore from LANG Smgalang Burong. An augur (tuai b.) must go out at dawn without food (or the birds will be content and not appear), and without bathing (or the birds will be wet and become ill). They also seek land for farming (ngiga' babas), so the augur may bring a paung embuas for success. If omens are not heard, an offering (piring) is made and set on the path, and nendak is called upon. To obtain a repeated call (of an associated omen, b. gempong, following the first sought), the scabbard must be tapped. When the repeated omen is heard, it is acknowledged with a further three offerings. If omens are heard but in the wrong order, the augur may return and say they were in the right order (bula' ka entua). IF a bad omen is heard, the augur will retire to the place prepared as a base (palan) and make a sacrifice (ninggang). For each omen heard, a stick or rod (kayu', paung) is taken. Seedlings of kemuntin or engkerebai are pre-ferred, but any tree without latex will serve. The plant is shaken first so that it will not be wet when taken. A ritual meal (asi' salau) is eaten. The paung are first brought to the forge (langkau kamboh) before being taken up into the house as honoured guests. Piring and tuak are given them, and fowls waved (biau) at the foot of the steps, half way up and at the top. The augur wears a pua' cloth and a sword, and carries an offering and the paung in another cloth. He is escorted by women playing gong music. The paung are carried thrice along the ruai, pausing at each door, and finally rest at the augur's door. Next morning they are divided into short lengths and tied in bundles of left-hand and right-hand omens with red thread; and so shared out to each bilik. After favourable dreams have been had, the major project for which the omens were sought may begin. B. selit, unwanted omen which spoils the sequence being sought and causes delay; b. sungkal, adverse or prohibitory omen (speaking harshly or roughly); gempong, complete, match, associate with (e.g., single ketupong after required numbers of left- and right-hand nendak); jaloh or kikih, inauspicious (of any omen, e.g., a bird flying the opposite way to yours, a branch falling when there is no wind); pimpin, flying or moving from right to left; perumpong, number of omens heard on each hand for any particular project; raup, flying from left to right; tengkelah, single bird call (esp. of ketupong). The omen birds proper are-ketupong, Rufous Piculet; beragai, Scarlet-rumped Trogon; papau or kelabu, Diard's Trogon; bejampong, Crested Jay; embuas (membuas), Banded Kingfisher; pangkas, Maroon Woodpecker; nendak, White-rumped Shama. There is no agreed order for these seven, except that ketupong is senior and first, living next to LANG downriver; while nendak is junior, and lives unmarried with his mother at or near the end of the house (pala' tangga') as watchman. Nendak is the most important for omens in all peaceful pursuits. The other six, and burong malam (see below) are sons-in-law of Lang. The alarm cries (nyawa begau) of ketupong (kikih, jaloh), of papau (senabong) and of pangkas (kutok) are said to have origin-ated in their cries of triumph on winning a dis-pute as to whether an ensurai tree would fall into the river or onto the land. Other birds give omens, as do many animals, reptiles, and insects, but these minor ones are seldom sought now because they are hard to get in correct sequence. Beriak (Tailorbird) is good in war; raja burong (kuong kapong) is good at gawai batu but costly; tucok (gecko) is good when creating new sacred stones at gawai batu. Burong malam, a cricket, Gryllacris nigrilabns, is good in war and cockfighting. If heard at night, it causes fear and a sampi must be said; it is rare by day and is then disregarded. B. malam accompanies nendak to get the Wind to warn the deities of a gawai batu. He lives among bamboo and is not a full member of Lang's house, for his wife is Lang's youngest daughter who committed incest (mali) with SURONG GUNTING. B. malam is given greater importance in Paku and Rimbas. Elsewhere, he and jeruit are sometimes called 'hounds' (fiasun) of Antu Gerasi. Other insects giving omens include, bunsa, kunding, long, manyi', mengalai, rejah, rekai, rioh, selempandai. Primary omens sought in preparation for war (kayau) are bejampong and jaloh, followed by any bird pimpin. For building houses (rumah), nendak is primary (left-hand and odd numbers for the women, right-hand and some-times even numbers for the men, as is usu. with nendak omens) with papau and others according to individual practice. Ketupong is good when making the steps. In padi-farming (umai), nendak is primary but other omens sought will vary with local practice and the kind of forest to be cleared"}]},{"word":"buru","meanings":[{"definition":"Drive away, send away, ostracize","examples":["ia muru aku ari rumah ia, he drove me from his longhouse","ia pemuru manok, it's her job to drive away the fowls"],"synonyms":[],"note":""},{"definition":"(M.)
